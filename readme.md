Inspired by the fantastic [Hooked](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hooked) mod by TheCodeWarrior.

Many thanks to TheCodeWarrior for the original idea and some of the assets, all credit should go to him.

 

Since the [Hooked mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hooked) is no longer updating I thought I'd try and bring it back.

It provides multiple hooks each with unique stats, most provide speedy transportation, some provide limited creative flight.

 

The hooks need to be put into the "Hook" curio slot to be active.

There's a keybind for shooting a hook (by default 'C'), pressing shift and said key while looking at a hook will retract this hook.

There's also a keybind for retracting all hooks ('space' by default), though it is not enabled for the red "creative flight" hook.

 

While a player is moving by hook all fall damage is disabled, this means hook "clutches" are possible.

 

Note: The current version is still work in progress, that means that there are still some bugs to iron out, if you find anything please let me know and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible.

 

For modpack creators: in the spirit of open source and the original creator feel free to use this mod in your modpacks, also feel free to comment here with the name of your modpack, I'd love to see people use the mod :)
